Boris Bikes
===========

This task was set by Enrique Comba Riepenhausen (@ecomba) whilst learning to
code at Makers Academy. The purpose was to build an object oriented model
of the Travel for London Cycle Hire scheme.

I paired with Yuin Huang (github.com/Yuin23). We started by writing CRC cards
(Class, Responsibilities, Collaborators) with pen and paper. Then we used RSpec
to develop our model using TDD.

This model could be improved by drying out the cross-cutting concern of
storing bikes in the Station, Garage and Van classes. A BikeStore module might
be appropriate.
